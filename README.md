# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import the numpy module for using built-in function for calculation
2. From scipy.linalg import built-in functions
3. Prepare the lists from the linear equation and assign in np.array()
4. Use  lu(),lu_solve() and lu_factor to get the solutions 
5. End the program

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix

## Output:
![lu decomposition]()


## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
